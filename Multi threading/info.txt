multi threading can be implements in two ways.
1. extends Thread class
    This is easier method, skips one step.
    But problem with this is only one class is extended in java, only one subclass is allowed. no multiple inheritance.
    thus, if u want to use extends for your own purpose then u cant extends thread class.

2. implements Runnable interface
    One line extra but overcomes above problem.
    U can have as many interfaces implemented on the same class.
    ans plus u can extend your class for your use.
