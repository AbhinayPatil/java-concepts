    - uses implements keyword
    - predefined public static final modifiers
    - only abstract methods(no body)
    - USE CASE

    - no predefined modifiers   
    - can have both abstract and non abstract methods
    - USE CASES
        - when u know the ingredients and also little bit of the recipe.
